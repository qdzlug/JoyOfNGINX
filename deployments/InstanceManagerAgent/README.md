# Important Notes
1. This is a POC playbook and requires manual editing currently. Future revisions will 
be not as rough, and will use variables, and generally do things right.
2. This version expects that $HOME evaluates to /home/ubuntu. As noted above, this is 
really rough.
3. This playbook also does not validate the SSL cert.
